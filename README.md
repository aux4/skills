## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/aux4` | Explains how aux4 works — CLI generator, `.aux4` files, profiles, commands, variables, executors |
| `/aux4-package` | Creates aux4 packages from scratch — Go and JS, build, publish, release |
| `/aux4-command` | Adds commands to existing `.aux4` files — profiles, variables, man pages, tests |
| `/aux4-test` | Creates and runs `.test.md` test files — execute, expect, error, file blocks, hooks |
| `/aux4-docs` | Updates README.md and man pages — structure, conventions, keeping docs in sync |
| `/aux4-config` | Works with `config.yaml` files — get, set, merge, nested paths, `--config` flag |
| `/aux4-agent` | Creates AI agents using `aux4/ai-agent` — instructions, model config, tools, chat |
| `/aux4-copilot-skill` | Creates copilot skills — AI-driven or shell-based patterns for the aux4 copilot |

## How It Works

- **CLAUDE.md** loads automatically in every Claude Code session, giving Claude context about the aux4 ecosystem and available skills
- **Skills** are invoked on demand with `/skill-name` or automatically when Claude determines they are relevant to your request
- Each skill contains detailed instructions, examples, and conventions so Claude can generate correct aux4 code
